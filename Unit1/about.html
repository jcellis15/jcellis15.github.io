	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Jonathan Ellis. I'm a Graphic Designer living in Brooklyn, New York. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I want to expand my skill-set as a Graphic Designer. I've already learned how to somewhat code because of the nature of my job but I've never been formally taught the in and outs, the language, and the detail of how to properly develop a site. I feel this class will help mebring it all together</p>

	<h2>My Mission</h2>
	<p> As I learn more about front-end, I hope to further my career at <em>"The Orchard"</em> (my current employer) and combine my development skills with my design and illustration background</p>

	<h2>My Experience</h2>
	<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Freelance Graphic Designer,</strong> Episode 21<br><em>Brooklyn,NY  2008-2009</em></li>
	 	<li><strong>Graphic Assistant,</strong> Music Choice<br><em>New York, NY 2009-2013</em></li>
	 	<li><strong>Graphic Designer,</strong> The Orchard<br><em>New York, NY 2013-2014</em></li>
       	</ul>

       	<h2>Education</h2>
       	<p><strong> School of Visual Arts:</strong> Bachelors in Cartooning and Illustration</p>
