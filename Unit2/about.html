		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p> My name is Jonathan Ellis. I'm a Graphic Designer living in Brooklyn, New York. I became interested in Front-End Web <br> Design and Development because I want to expand my skill-set as a Graphic Designer. I've already <br>learned how to somewhat code because of the nature of my job but I've never been formally taught<br> the in and outs, the language, and the detail of how to properly develop a site.  I feel this class will help me <br>bring it all together </p>

		<h2>My Mission</h2>
		<p> As I learn more about front-end, I hope to further my career  <br>at <em>"The Orchard"</em>(my current employer) and combine my <br> development skills with my design and illustration background </p>

		<h2>My Experience</h2>
		<p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>
		<ul>
		 <li><strong>Freelance Graphic Designer,</strong> Episode 21 <br> <em>Brooklyn,NY  2008-2009</em></li>
		 <br>
		 <li><strong>Graphic Assistant,</strong> Music Choice <br> <em>New York, NY 2009-2013</em></li>
		 <br>
         <li><strong>Graphi Designer,</strong> The Orchard <br> <em>New York, NY 2013-2014</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Education</h2>
