       <h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
<p> I was most inspired by <a href="http://yodabaz.com" target="_blank">yodabaz.com</a> and 
<a href="http://www.operaballet.nl" target="_blank">operaballet.nl</a> To me both sites were well designed and instantly caught my eye. </p>

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
<p>The yodobaz portfolio site relies on a strong focal point to engage the user immediately. It achieves this by having the main clickable <br> content clustered into one spot there by creating lots of negative space. The designer also used the size of the buttons  to create a distinct hiearchy. <br> <br>The  opera site also uses focal point and hierarchy  to lead the users eye to what is important. I am able to realize the huge text is probably <br>the name of the opera,the smaller links will lead me to more info about the opera.  Furthermore the "i" icon placed at the bottom encourages the user <br> to scroll down creating a flow. </p> 

<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
<p>Both home pages use simple design to make it visually easy to navigate but also use video to bring life and complexity to the overall look of the site. One difference <br> between the two sites is the use of flow. The ballet website use a well placed "i" icon at the bottom to guide the users eye to the bottom making the user <br> want to explore and scroll down. </p>

<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><figure>
                <h3>Thumbnail 1</h3>
             <img src="img/thumbnail_1.jpg" height="300"></img>
                <p>This first sketch relies mostly on focal point to be effective. All of the links are bunched together and drags your eye to one section of the page. The negative space <br> it  leave helps it be a focal point and achieve balance.The background picture being placed all the way to the left also helps to achieve this goal. I was able to <br> demonstrate hierarchy  by making the linked buttons seem bigger than the site name making it more important.</p>
            </figure></li>
            <li><figure>
                <h3>Thumbnail 2</h3>
                <img src="img/thumbnail_2.jpg" height="300"></img>
                <p>The second sketch relies heavily on hierarchy and balance to meet its goal. Its is obvious the two big boxes at the top are the focal point of the design because its bigger <br> than everything else on the page, thus establishing a hiearchy. </p>
            </figure></li>
        </ul>
